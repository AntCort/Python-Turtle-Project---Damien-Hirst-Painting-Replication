# Turtle Painting Project

Welcome to the Turtle Painting project! This project uses Python's Turtle graphics module to create colorful paintings using dots. The colors are extracted from an image and applied to the dots, resulting in beautiful and unique artwork.

## Project Overview

The Turtle Painting project is organized using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and consists of multiple files to enhance code modularity and organization. Here's an overview of the key components:

- **main.py:** This is the main entry point of the program. It initializes the TurtlePainter class and creates a painting.

- **turtle_painting.py:** This file defines the TurtlePainter class, which handles the painting process. It uses the Turtle graphics module to create paintings using colors extracted from an image.

- **color_extraction.py:** This file defines the ColorExtractor class, which is responsible for extracting colors from an image using the colorgram library.

## Getting Started

To run the Turtle Painting project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the GitHub repository to your local machine:

2. Install the required dependencies using pip:

3. Run the project by executing `main.py`:

## Usage

1. When you run the project, the Turtle graphics window will open, displaying a colorful painting created using dots.

2. The colors of the dots are extracted from an image provided in the `image_path` variable.

3. You can customize the number of rows and dots per row in the `create_painting` method in `turtle_painting.py`.
